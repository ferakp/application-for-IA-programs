        This application provides simple and comprehensive functionalities for testing different intelligent agents. It's intendend to highlight differences between different intelligent agent classes
        that are <b>reflex agents</b>, <b>model-based reflex agents</b>, <b>goal-based agents</b> and <b>utility agents</b>.
      </p>
      <p class="instructions_text pt-1">
        A reflex agent is a simple agent which reacts to perceptions according to its if-then rule table. A if-then rule table is made of conditions and their actions. 
      </p>
      <p class="instructions_text pt-1">
        A model-based reflex agent is a type of agent which reacts to perceptions according to its if-then rule table and stores perceptions. This type of agent is much more developed than simple reflex agent
        and it keeps a state of its environment. Thus, it doesn't only use if-then table but also information about its state.
      </p>
      <p class="instructions_text pt-2">
        A goal-based agent is a type of agent which has a goal instead of if-then table. It uses the state about its environment, perceptions and internal knowledge to choose actions which takes
        its closer to its goal. 
      </p>
      <p class="instructions_text pt-2">
        An utility agent differs from other agents with its utility function which selects actions based on how useful it is.
